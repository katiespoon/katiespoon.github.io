### About Me
I'm on the academic job market!
 
I am a computational social scientist and a 5th-year PhD candidate in computer science at the University of Colorado, Boulder (graduating in June 2025), where I am fortunate to be supported by an <a href="https://nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>, advised by <a href="https://aaronclauset.github.io/">Aaron Clauset</a> and <a href="https://larremorelab.github.io/">Dan Larremore</a>. I also just received a Master's in <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/education/academics/graduate-programs/educational-foundations-policy-practice/ma-educational-foundations">Education Policy</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/education/kevin-welner">Kevin Welner</a>. I am currently a Data Science Fellow at the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ehealth.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a>.

My research systematically investigates social inequalities in education, careers and health at scale to better inform policy decisions that address those inequalities. I enjoy using a diverse range of data science and social science methods to conduct large-scale, interdisciplinary administrative, survey, network, and text analyses, which often reveal patterns not visible at a smaller scale.

Prior to grad school, I worked as a research engineer at IBM Research, and studied computer science at Indiana University, where I developed an early-warning system to detect dyslexia in children's handwriting.
