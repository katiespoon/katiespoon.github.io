### About Me
<b>I am a <a href="https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-fellows">Data Science Fellow</a> and <a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/new-map-of-life-fellows-program/">New Map of Life Fellow</a> at Stanford, working with <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/stevens4">Mitchell Stevens</a> and <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-rehkopf">David Rehkopf</a>.</b> 

I received my PhD in computer science in 2025 at the University of Colorado Boulder, supported by an <a href="https://nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>, advised by <a href="https://aaronclauset.github.io/">Aaron Clauset</a> and <a href="https://larremorelab.github.io/">Dan Larremore</a>. During my PhD, I also received a Master's in <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/education/academics/graduate-programs/educational-foundations-policy-practice/ma-educational-foundations">Education Policy</a>, and spent time working as a Data Science Fellow at the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ehealth.html">U.S. Census Bureau</a> and a Graduate Research Assistant in the National Center for Women & Technology. 

<!---My research systematically investigates social inequalities in education, careers and health at scale to better inform policy decisions that address those inequalities. I enjoy using a diverse range of data science and social science methods to conduct large-scale, interdisciplinary administrative, survey, network, and text analyses, which often reveal patterns not visible at a smaller scale.
Prior to my PhD, I worked as a research engineer at IBM Research, and studied computer science at Indiana University, where I developed an early-warning system to detect dyslexia in children's handwriting.--->

<!--- After my postdoctoral fellowship, I will be starting as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.utep.edu/cs/about/">University of Texas-El Paso</a>, the only open-access R1 institution in the U.S. --->
